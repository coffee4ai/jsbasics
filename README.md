Learning JS

Coming from a system side programming back-ground with only a strong expertise in C programming language with a bit of C++, I was really confused when it came to learning a language which could help me build anything and everything on the web.

Started with Python, gave up - not something you would ever use for high scale production code. 

The came Node, for which I had to learn JS - A C guy would never even come close to JS.

So? Golang to the rescue with Front-end developed by Aliens!!
